# Objects

## What are objects?

* Objects are entities created by Python
  * they have state (data)
  * they have methods (functionality)
  * state and methods are encapsulated into Objects
* Integers (int) are Objects
  * Integers (int) have state - the value of the integer
  * Integers (int) also have functionality
    * knows how to add itself to another integer
    * knows how to represent itself as a string (for visual output)
* Float (float) numbers are objects 
  * state -> value
  * functionality -> add
    
## Everything in Python is an Object 

* Any data type we have in Python is an object
  * It has a state
  * It has functionality
  * These states/ functionality are called attributes
    
## Dot Notation

* Is used to access attributes of an object
  * car.brand -> accesses the brand attribute of the car object
  * car.model -> accesses the model attribute of the car object
* For attributes that represent functionality, we usually have to call the attribute to perform the action -> often supplying additional information (parameters)
  
## Mutability

* An object is mutable if its internal state (data) can be changed
  * One or more data attributes can be changed
  * for example: integers, floats, booleans...
* An object is immutable if its internal state cannot be changed
  * The state of the object is "set in stone."
  * for example: lists, dictionaries, sets...
